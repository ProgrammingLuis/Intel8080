<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I have always wondered how emulators worked and making my own is my way of learning about them. 

Things I have learned about while working on this project:
* Assembly and how to make a disassembler.
* CPUs/microprocessors
* Better debugging practices :smile:

This is just the start of my emulation journey. So I'll be emulating more hardware systems in the near future. Please let me know about any bugs/issues so that I can get better at this.

A list of commonly used resources that I found helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With
This was all done in Community Visual Studio 2019. 
* CPP

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

For now, I only have a working disassembler for files meant to run on the Intel 8080 microprocessor. 

### Prerequisites

To run this program you will need to make a .exe with g++ or compile the .cpp file in Visual Studio.
* g++
* Visual Studio

### Installation
```sh
g++ -Wall -pedantic disassembler.cpp
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

When finished, the program will be able to run a Space Invaders (1978) ROM.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/ProgrammingLuis/Intel8080/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
