<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I have always wondered how emulators worked and making my own is my way of learning about them. 

Things I have learned about while working on this project:
* Assembly and how to make a disassembler.
* CPUs/microprocessors
* Hardware - displays/inputs
* Better debugging practices :smile:

This is just the start of my emulation journey. So I'll be emulating more hardware systems in the near future. Please let me know about any bugs/issues so that I can get better at this.

A list of commonly used resources that I found helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With
This was all done in Community Visual Studio 2019. 
* C++
* SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

For now, Intel 8080 compiled files will run, but they are waiting for input from external hardware.This will be implemented soon.

### Prerequisites

To run this program you will need to compile the files in Visual Studio.
* Visual Studio

### Installation
```sh
Visual C++
* To build this project in Visual C++, first download disassembler.h, disassembler.cpp, and CPU.cpp, then build and run the program.
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

When finished, the program will be able to run a Space Invaders (1978) ROM.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/ProgrammingLuis/Intel8080/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
